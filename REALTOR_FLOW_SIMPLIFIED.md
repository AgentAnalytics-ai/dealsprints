# ✅ Simplified Realtor Flow - NO FLUFF

## The Flow (What Realtors Actually Want)

```
1. Login → /login
2. Subscribe → Stripe checkout
3. Dashboard → /realtor/dashboard
4. SEE EVERYTHING → All scraping data, no filters, no complexity
```

## What Changed

### Before (Too Complex):
- ❌ Scraper was paused
- ❌ Filtered out RSS feeds
- ❌ Only showed "published/approved" status
- ❌ Too many filters and complexity
- ❌ Unclear what data was being shown

### After (Simple & Direct):
- ✅ Scraper enabled (runs daily at 6am)
- ✅ Shows ALL data types (permits, licenses, RSS feeds, everything)
- ✅ Shows ALL statuses (everything we're tracking)
- ✅ Simple filters (optional, not required)
- ✅ Clear: "Here's everything happening in OKC"

## What Realtors See

**Dashboard shows:**
- **Everything we're scraping** - All data types, all sources
- **Map view** - See where things are happening
- **List view** - See all items in a feed
- **Simple filters** - Optional filters if they want to narrow down

**No fluff:**
- No complex scoring (unless useful)
- No unnecessary features
- Just: "Here's what's happening in OKC right now"

## Data Sources Being Scraped

1. **RSS Feeds** (Government & Economic Development):
   - City of OKC News
   - Greater OKC Partnership

   - OKC Chamber
   - i2E Innovation

2. **Public Data** (When enabled):
   - Building Permits
   - Liquor Licenses
   - Business Licenses

   - Zoning Changes

## The Value Proposition

**For Realtors:**
- "See everything happening in OKC before your competition"
- "Track permits, licenses, developments in one place"
