# Legal Monetization Strategy: How to Make Money

## ❌ What You CAN'T Do

**You CANNOT:**
- ❌ Sell/gate copyrighted content (NonDoc, Journal Record articles)
- ❌ Charge for access to rewritten news articles
- ❌ Monetize content you don't own

**Why:** Copyright law - you don't own the content, you can't sell it.

## ✅ What You CAN Do (Legal Ways to Make Money)

### 1. **Business Intelligence Platform** (Recommended)

**What it is:** You provide ORIGINAL analysis and insights, not the copyrighted content.

**How it works:**
- You analyze public data (permits, licenses, filings)
- You create ORIGINAL insights about what it means
- You provide actionable intelligence (not the news itself)

**Example:**
- ❌ "Here's a Journal Record article" (copyrighted - can't sell)
- ✅ "3 new restaurants coming to Bricktown in next 60 days" (your original analysis - CAN sell)

**Monetization:**
- Pro subscription: $49-99/month for real-time intelligence
- Enterprise: $299+/month for API access
- Custom reports: $500-2000 one-time

### 2. **Lead Generation Service**

**What it is:** You find business opportunities and sell the leads.

**How it works:**
- You identify new businesses (from public filings)
- You identify expansion opportunities (from permits)
- You sell leads to relevant businesses (contractors, suppliers, etc.)

**Monetization:**
- Lead packages: $99-299/month for X leads
- Per-lead pricing: $10-50 per qualified lead
- Commission: 10-20% of deals you facilitate

**Legal:** Public data (business filings, permits) is legal to use for lead gen.

### 3. **Network/Marketplace Platform**

**What it is:** You connect businesses with each other.

**How it works:**

- Facilitate deals

**Monetization:**

- Commission on deals: 5-15%
- Featured listings: $99-299/month

**Legal:** You're providing a service, not selling content.

### 4. **Data API Service**

**What it is:** You provide structured data access via API.

**How it works:**
- Aggregate public data (permits, licenses, filings)
- Structure it in a useful way
- Provide API access

**Monetization:**
- API access: $299-999/month
- Per-request pricing: $0.10-1.00 per API call
- Enterprise: Custom pricing

**Legal:** Public data is legal to aggregate and sell access to.

### 5. **Consulting/Advisory Service**

**What it is:** You provide business intelligence consulting.

**How it works:**
- Analyze market trends
- Provide strategic insights
- Custom reports and recommendations

**Monetization:**
